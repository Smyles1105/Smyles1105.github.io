# Homelab Overview

Welcome to my homelab — a continually evolving environment I use for certification prep, hands-on technical learning, and resume-building projects. This setup allows me to explore topics like virtualization, networking, monitoring, deployment, and automation in a controlled space.

## Purpose

The homelab exists to support:
- Certification learning (currently CompTIA A+ and soon Net+/CCNA or linux+)
- Resume-ready IT projects and self-hosted services
- Continued development of my technical and documentation skills
- Services related to my hobbies like game servers.

## Current Lab Focus Areas

- Migrating core services to a dedicated Proxmox host (Lenovo M920q)
- Rebuilding local DNS + VPN via Raspberry Pi 4
- Creating documentation for service setup and configuration
- Preparing a Windows AD lab environment for testing and deployment exercises
